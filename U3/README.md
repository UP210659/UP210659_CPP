## INSTRUCTIONS
</div> 
</h1>  

### HOW TO PLAY  (LINUX)
1. Download or clone the directory in github. (Using the command git clone https://github.com/UP210659/UP210659_CPP.git). Later you go to U3 and GATO.CPP or you just go to the code [CODE TIC TAC TOE](03_Gato.cpp).  
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler and that it runs the code.
3. The game is one against one
4. To enter the game you must put the number one, if you put a different number the game ends and it does not let you enter
5. Later the game will ask you for the name of player 1 and player 2. 
<br /><br /><br /> 
  
### GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
1. Player 1 is assigned "X" and is the same color as his name (blue)  
   
 _note: player 1 will always do "X"_  

2. Player 2 is assigned "0" and is the same color as his name (cyan)  

 _note: player 2 will always do "0"_  
3. Consider that if there are three in a line you win, it can be diagonal, horizontal or vertical   
### _ERRORS_  
1. On the game board it does not specify that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "0"

## CONCLUSION 
</div> 
</h1>    
In conclusion, this program was a bit complicated to make, because there were many functions that I didn't know how they were executed or what they did...
