### HOW TO PLAY  (LINUX)
1. Download or clone the directory in github. (Using the command git clone https://github.com/UP210659/UP210659_CPP.git). Later you go to U3 and GATO.CPP or you just go to the code [CODE TIC TAC TOE](03_Gato.cpp).  
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler and that it runs the code.
3. The game is one against one
4. To enter the game you must put the number one, if you put a different number the game ends and it does not let you enter
